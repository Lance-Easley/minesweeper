# Minesweeper

This is a classic recreation of minesweeper. 
I used Pygame to render a window and allow graphical interaction.

## Usage

When you launch the program, you are shown a grid with an area in the middle already cleared. 
To mine a square, click on it.
To flag a square, hover over it with your mouse and press `f`.
The game ends when you either mine a bomb, resulting in a loss, or when you mine every square and leave only bombs, resulting in a win.
